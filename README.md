A mobile app designed to help you digitally manage your closet and pick out clothes for you to wear based on personal preference, temperature and other factors.

## Developing
To get started first install the NativeScript CLI
```
npm install -g nativescript
```
Next you should prepare your environment to have the necessary tools installed. You should check the [Guide](https://docs.nativescript.org/environment-setup.html) on NativeScript on how to do that.

Next you should clone this repository and install the node modules
```
npm i
```

To run the app you should use
```
ns run android # Android
ns run ios     # IOS
```

Or alternatively to enable hotsync
```
ns debug android # Android
ns debug ios     # IOS
```
